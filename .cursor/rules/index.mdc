# Argus Risk Observatory (ARO) Rules Index

This is the master index for all cursor rules. Use this file to selectively apply rules to your current task by mentioning which categories or specific rules are relevant.

## Available Rules

| Category                   | Rule File                           | Description                                                                                        | When to Apply                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Core Rules**             | `core/aro-vision-and-scope.mdc`     | Product intent, success criteria, and MVP scope (countries first, dimensions, sources)             | When debating scope creep, prioritising roadmap, or aligning technical decisions to the end goal |
|                            | `core/tech-stack.mdc`               | Full ARO stack overview: infra, services, data pipeline, storage, API, and frontend                | When setting up repos/services, reviewing architecture, or preventing layering violations        |
|                            | `core/domain-expertise-actor.mdc`   | Ubiquitous language and Actor-based domain model (Signal→Event→Deed→Impact→Risk) for LLM grounding | When modelling domain objects, designing ingestion/risk pipelines, or grounding LLM behaviour    |
| **Development Guidelines** | `core/naming-conventions.mdc`       | File naming conventions for Java/Spring (PascalCase) and Next.js (kebab-case), including tests     | When creating files/folders, refactoring modules, scaffolding services, or during code reviews   |
| **Code Quality**           | `core/code-style.mdc`               | Code style and structure: early returns, functional components, clean code, no debug artifacts     | When writing new code, refactoring, or reviewing code for style consistency                      |
|                            | `core/code-quality.mdc`             | Code quality practices: technical debt tracking, refactoring, documentation, reviews               | During maintenance cycles, code reviews, or when addressing technical debt                       |
| **Security**               | `core/security.mdc`                 | Security hardening: CSP, input validation, rate limiting, secrets management, Zod validation       | When implementing API routes, handling user input, or reviewing security posture                 |

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Selective Application**: Apply only the rules relevant to your current task
2. **Context Matters**: Consider the specific context and requirements when applying rules
3. **Consistency**: Use the same rules consistently within a feature or component
4. **Review**: Regularly review and update rule application based on project needs

## Quick Reference

- **New Feature Development**: Apply `aro-vision-and-scope`, `domain-expertise-actor`, `naming-conventions`, `code-style`
- **Ingestion/Pipeline Work**: Apply `tech-stack`, `domain-expertise-actor`, `naming-conventions`
- **Risk Engine Work**: Apply `domain-expertise-actor`, `tech-stack`, `code-quality`
- **API Development**: Apply `tech-stack`, `security`, `naming-conventions`
- **Frontend/Dashboard**: Apply `tech-stack`, `code-style`, `naming-conventions`
- **Code Review**: Apply `code-style`, `code-quality`, `naming-conventions`, `security`
- **Architecture Decisions**: Apply `aro-vision-and-scope`, `tech-stack`, `domain-expertise-actor`

## Creating New Rules

To create a new rule file, use the provided template:

1. **Copy the template**: Use `templates/template.mdc` as a starting point
2. **Replace placeholders**: Update all `[PLACEHOLDER]` text with actual content
3. **Customize sections**: Remove unused sections and add new ones as needed
4. **Update the index**: Add your new rule to the appropriate category table above
5. **Follow conventions**: Use kebab-case for filenames and be descriptive

### Template Structure

The template includes:

- **Frontmatter**: Description and application settings
- **Main content**: Organized sections with subsections
- **Examples**: Code snippets showing good/bad practices
- **Checklists**: Actionable implementation items
- **Related rules**: Cross-references to other rules
- **Usage instructions**: Built-in guidance for template usage

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case: `my-new-rule.mdc`
- Be descriptive but concise
- Follow the pattern: `[category]-[specific-topic].mdc`

### Integration

When adding a new rule, update this index by adding an entry to the appropriate category table:

```markdown
| **Category**      | Rule File       | Description       | When to Apply           |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Your Category** | `your-rule.mdc` | Brief description | When to apply this rule |
```
