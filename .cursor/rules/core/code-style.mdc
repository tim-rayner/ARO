## Code Style & Structure

- Use early returns to reduce nesting.
- Prefer functional components. Avoid class components except where required (e.g. client-side error boundaries).
- Remove unused imports and variables.
- Don't leave console.log() or debug code.
- Use descriptive names for variables and functions.
- Don't over comment - don't leave comments in the code unless they would help give a future developer context and don't add comments that simply restate what the code does. Prefer private functions names that self document the code.
