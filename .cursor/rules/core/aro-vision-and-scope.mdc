# Argus Risk Observatory — Vision and Scope

This rule defines the **non-negotiable intent, success criteria, and MVP boundaries** for Argus Risk Observatory (ARO). Its purpose is to act as a grounding document when aligning architecture, data modelling, and delivery decisions to the end goal of the system.

## Product Intent

### What ARO Is

- ARO is a **real-time global risk intelligence system**
- It ingests open-source intelligence (OSINT) continuously
- It normalises raw events into a shared domain language (**deeds**)
- It computes evolving risk states over time
- It prioritises explainability and traceability over prediction

### What ARO Is Not

- Not a news reader or media aggregator
- Not a sentiment-analysis dashboard
- Not a forecasting or trading engine
- Not a one-off reporting tool

### Core Questions ARO Must Answer

- What is happening?
- Where is risk changing?
- Why did that change occur?

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success

- Events flow end-to-end through the pipeline without manual intervention
- Deeds are deterministic, deduplicated, and replayable
- Risk snapshots can be recomputed from historical data
- Late or duplicated data does not corrupt system state

### Domain Success

- Real-world incidents cause visible, explainable risk movement
- Risk deltas can be traced back to contributing deeds
- Multiple sources converge into a single, coherent narrative
- Noise is reduced rather than amplified

### Product Success

- A knowledgeable user can answer:
  - What changed in the last X hours?
  - Which countries are becoming more unstable?
  - Which dimensions are driving that instability?

### Explicit Non-Success States

- Scores cannot be explained
- UI exists without strong backing data
- Features are added without upstream data justification
- Architecture bends to a single data source

## MVP Scope

### Entities (Countries First)

- MVP entity type is **Country** only
- Countries are identified by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes
- Aggregation and scoring occur strictly at the country level

Explicitly out of scope for MVP:

- Organisations
- Regions or cities
- Individuals

### Countries Covered

- Global by default, constrained only by data availability
- Uneven or sparse coverage is acceptable
- No artificial regional restrictions

### Risk Dimensions (MVP)

- GEOPOLITICAL
- CYBER
- SOCIAL

Out of scope for MVP:

- Economic modelling
- Infrastructure dependency graphs
- Predictive dimensions

### Data Sources (MVP)

- GDELT (geopolitical and social events)
- URLhaus (cyber infrastructure indicators)

All additional sources are deferred until:

- Deed language is proven stable
- Risk engine behaviour is understood

### Deeds Language

- A **deed** is the canonical, normalised unit of occurrence in ARO
- Deeds are derived from external events
- All ingestion outputs deeds, never raw events
- Deeds must include:
  - Observed time
  - Source reference
  - Affected entity/entities
  - Classification and severity

### Risk Snapshots

- A risk snapshot represents point-in-time state
- Snapshots are immutable once written
- Snapshots must be explainable via upstream deeds

## Key Principles

- Event-first over UI-first
- Explainability over sophistication
- Deterministic systems over opaque ones
- Narrow MVP over premature breadth

## Examples

### Scope Creep Example

```typescript
// Good: aligns with MVP scope
addNewFeed("GDELT_EXPANDED");

// Bad: introduces new entity type prematurely
addOrganisationRiskScoring("GlobalBankPLC");
```

### Technical Trade-off Example

```typescript
// Good: preserves replayability
computeRiskFromDeeds(deeds, snapshotTime);

// Bad: mutates historical state
mutateExistingSnapshot(snapshotId);
```

## When to Apply

- Proposing a new data source
- Adding a new entity or dimension
- Debating roadmap priority
- Making architectural or persistence decisions

## Related Rules

- Deeds vs Events: Defines domain language and normalisation boundary
- Risk Engine Design: Governs scoring, decay, and snapshot logic

## Notes

This document is intentionally restrictive. Constraint is a feature. Any deviation must be justified against the product intent and success criteria above.
