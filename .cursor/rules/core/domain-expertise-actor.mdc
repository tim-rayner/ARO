# Domain Expertise & Ubiquitous Language (Actor Model)

This document defines the **core domain language** used throughout Argus Risk Observatory (ARO), using **Actor** as the primary risk-bearing subject. It establishes strict semantic boundaries between raw data, observations, interpretations, and derived risk state.

This file exists primarily to **anchor LLM behaviour**, ensuring consistent reasoning, naming, and interpretation across all ARO applications.

## Signal

### Definition

A **Signal** is a raw, untrusted data record emitted by an external source.

### Description

Signals represent _incoming noise_ from the outside world. They are source-specific, high-volume, and often redundant, delayed, or contradictory. Signals have **no intrinsic business meaning** inside Argus.

### Examples

- A single row in a GDELT CSV file
- A URLhaus malware feed entry
- A NetBlocks disruption report

### Rules

- Signals are **not domain objects**
- Signals are **never persisted long-term**
- Signals must be **transformed into Events or discarded**
- Signals must never directly affect risk

## Event

### Definition

An **Event** is a normalized, time-bound observation that something occurred in the real world.

### Description

Events are structured, source-agnostic observations derived from Signals. They describe **what was observed**, not intent, severity, or consequence.

Events remain _descriptive_, not _interpretive_.

### Examples

- Protest reported in Paris
- Government statement issued by Russia
- Cyber incident reported affecting UK infrastructure

### Rules

- Events represent **facts as observed**
- Events may reference **multiple actors**
- Events do **not** imply risk by themselves
- Events are still external observations, not domain decisions

## Deed

### Definition

A **Deed** is an intentional or consequential action inferred from one or more Events.

### Description

Deeds represent _what was actually done_, rather than what was merely reported. They are **domain-owned interpretations** that translate observations into meaningful actions.

This abstraction intentionally decouples Argus from any single data source.

### Examples

- Civil unrest
- Military escalation
- Economic sanction imposed
- Cyber attack

### Rules

- Deeds are **derived from Events**
- Deeds express **intent, action, or consequence**
- Deeds are the **primary drivers of risk**
- Deeds are opinionated and owned by Argus

### Example

```json
{
  "deedId": "gdelt:20260105-123456",
  "observedAt": "2026-01-05T21:38:12Z",
  "actors": ["country:GB"],
  "category": "POLITICAL_UNREST",
  "severity": 0.78,
  "source": "GDELT",
  "headline": "Large-scale protests reported in central London",
  "confidence": 0.81,
  "sourceRef": {
    "dataset": "GDELT",
    "fileId": "20260105213000.export.CSV"
  }
}
```

## Deed Type

### Definition

A **Deed Type** is a controlled, finite taxonomy describing the category of action represented by a Deed.

### Description

Deed Types provide a **stable semantic layer** across multiple data feeds. They intentionally abstract away vendor-specific classifications (e.g. GDELT CAMEO codes).

### Examples

- CIVIL_UNREST
- MILITARY_ESCALATION
- POLITICAL_STATEMENT
- ECONOMIC_SANCTION
- CYBER_ATTACK
- INFRASTRUCTURE_DISRUPTION

### Rules

- Deed Types are **domain-owned**
- The taxonomy evolves **slowly and deliberately**
- External classifications must map _into_ Deed Types, never the reverse

## Actor

### Definition

An **Actor** is a real-world actor or object whose risk profile can change over time.

### Description

Actors are the **primary subjects of risk scoring**. Any object that can be impacted by a Deed and accumulate risk qualifies as an Actor.

### Phase 1 Actors

- COUNTRY (ISO-3166)

### Future Actors

- ORGANISATION
- REGION
- CRITICAL_INFRASTRUCTURE

### Rules

- If risk can change → it is an Actor
- Actors are **stable and uniquely identifiable**
- Actor identity must not depend on data source

### Example

```json
{
  "actorId": "country:GB",
  "type": "COUNTRY",
  "name": "United Kingdom",
  "isoCode": "GB",
  "region": "Europe"
}
```

## Impact

### Definition

An **Impact** is the quantified effect a Deed has on an Actor within a specific risk dimension.

### Description

Impacts translate qualitative actions into **measurable change**. They are bounded, dimension-specific, and decay over time.

### Examples

- Civil unrest → SOCIAL +12
- Cyber attack → CYBER +18
- Economic sanction → ECONOMIC +9

### Rules

- Impacts are **derived from Deeds**
- Impacts **decay over time**
- Impacts are **additive but bounded**
- Impacts never exist without a Deed

## Risk Dimension

### Definition

A **Risk Dimension** represents a category of systemic risk tracked by Argus.

### Dimensions

- CYBER
- GEOPOLITICAL
- ECONOMIC
- INFRASTRUCTURE
- SOCIAL

### Rules

- Every Impact applies to **exactly one dimension**
- Dimensions enable **multi-vector risk analysis**
- Dimensions are stable and rarely change

## Risk Snapshot

### Definition

A **Risk Snapshot** is the computed risk state of an Actor at a specific point in time.

### Description

Risk Snapshots represent **derived state**, not raw truth. They are produced by aggregating active Impacts and applying decay functions.

### Rules

- Snapshots are **reproducible**
- Snapshots are **time-indexed**
- Snapshots are suitable for **visualisation and alerting**

### Example

```json
{
  "actorId": "country:GB",
  "snapshotTime": "2026-01-05T22:45:00Z",
  "overallScore": 0.67,
  "dimensions": {
    "political": 0.72,
    "economic": 0.61,
    "security": 0.83,
    "environmental": 0.41
  },
  "confidence": 0.94,
  "lastUpdatedFrom": "risk-engine"
}
```

## Risk Delta

### Definition

A **Risk Delta** is the change in risk between two Risk Snapshots.

### Description

Risk Deltas explain **what changed** and **why**. They are the primary trigger for analyst attention and alerting.

### Rules

- Deltas are **derived, not stored**
- Deltas reference **contributing Deeds**
- Deltas must be explainable

### Example

```json
{
  "actorId": "country:GB",
  "fromSnapshot": "2026-01-05T20:00:00Z",
  "toSnapshot": "2026-01-05T21:00:00Z",
  "overallDelta": 0.04,
  "dimensionDeltas": {
    "political": 0.06,
    "security": 0.02
  },
  "topContributingDeeds": [
    {
      "deedId": "gdelt:20260105-123456",
      "category": "POLITICAL_UNREST",
      "impactScore": 0.03
    }
  ],
  "explanationSummary": "Risk increased due to coordinated political unrest events in the capital."
}
```

## Source File

### Definition

A **Source File** is a fetched external dataset instance used during ingestion.

### Description

Source Files exist solely for **traceability, idempotency, and replay**. They are not part of the analytical domain model.

### Examples

- GDELT 15-minute update file
- URLhaus daily dump

### Rules

- Source Files support ingestion bookkeeping only
- Source Files never affect risk directly

## Risk History

### Definition

A **time-series view** of Risk Snapshots for an Actor.

### Description

Risk History is optimised for **charts, trends, and longitudinal analysis**, not computation.

### Example

```json
{
  "actorId": "country:GB",
  "interval": "1h",
  "from": "2026-01-05T00:00:00Z",
  "to": "2026-01-05T23:00:00Z",
  "points": [
    { "time": "2026-01-05T18:00:00Z", "overallScore": 0.62 },
    { "time": "2026-01-05T19:00:00Z", "overallScore": 0.63 },
    { "time": "2026-01-05T20:00:00Z", "overallScore": 0.66 },
    { "time": "2026-01-05T21:00:00Z", "overallScore": 0.67 }
  ]
}
```

- Never allow raw data to influence risk directly
- Prefer explainability over complexity
- Domain language must remain stable across implementations

- When modelling domain objects
- When implementing risk computation
- When prompting or grounding LLM behaviour
- When reviewing naming or architectural decisions
