## Security Hardening

- **Content Security Policy**: Implement strict CSP headers
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets, use environment variables
- Validate all API route inputs and form data.
- Never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
- Protect API routes from unauthorized access.
- Be mindful of CSRF protection; rely on Next.js built-ins where possible.
- Use Zod schemas for validating and parsing all API inputs and outputs; define schemas close to usage and always handle validation errors gracefully.
